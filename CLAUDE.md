```

## Current Architecture

The app uses a **simplified direct Core Data integration** pattern rather than full MVVM:

### Core Data Integration
- **Entities**: `Task` and `TaskCategory` with CloudKit synchronization enabled
- **Stack**: `PersistenceController` for CloudKit sync, `CoreDataStack` for basic operations
- **Extensions**: Entity extensions in `Core/Models/` provide computed properties and business logic

### SwiftUI Pattern
- **Views**: Direct `@FetchRequest` integration in SwiftUI views
- **State Management**: `@AppStorage` for user preferences, `@State` for local view state
- **Navigation**: Tab-based navigation with sheet presentations for details

### Services
- **NotificationManager**: Singleton for scheduling/canceling task notifications
- **No Repository Layer**: Views interact directly with Core Data through FetchRequest

## Core Features

### Task Management
- Create, edit, delete tasks with title, notes, and priority
- Priority levels (high, medium, low) with color-coded visual indicators
- Due dates with local notifications via UNUserNotificationCenter
- Subtasks and hierarchical task relationships (Core Data model supports this)
- Task completion with progress tracking for parent tasks
- Search functionality and category-based filtering
- Swipe actions and context menus for quick task operations
- Task postponing with date picker

### Categories & Organization
- Color-coded categories with custom icons
- Category-based task filtering via picker in main view
- Category management with creation, editing, and deletion
- Task count display for each category

### Advanced Features
- Offline-first with CloudKit synchronization (NSPersistentCloudKitContainer)
- Local notifications scheduled for task due dates
- Dark/light mode support with @AppStorage persistence
- Tab-based navigation (Tasks, Categories, Settings, Insights)
- Settings management for notifications and display preferences
- Data clearing functionality

### Extensions (Placeholder Structure)
- **Widget**: Home screen widgets structure exists (ToDoWidget/)
- **Apple Watch**: Companion app structure exists (ModernToDoApp Watch App/)
- **Share Extension**: Share extension structure exists (Share Extension/)

## Development Commands

### Building and Running
```bash
# Build the main app
xcodebuild -project ModernToDoApp.xcodeproj -scheme ModernToDoApp build

# Run tests
xcodebuild -project ModernToDoApp.xcodeproj -scheme ModernToDoApp test

# Build for simulator
xcodebuild -project ModernToDoApp.xcodeproj -scheme ModernToDoApp -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' build
```

## Key Files and Architecture

### Core Data Stack
- `ModernToDoApp/Core/PersistenceController.swift` - CloudKit-enabled Core Data stack
- `ModernToDoApp/Core/CoreDataStack.swift` - Simplified Core Data stack (used by main app)
- `ModernToDoApp/Core/TaskModel.xcdatamodeld/` - Core Data model with Task and TaskCategory entities

### Entity Extensions (ModernToDoApp/Core/Models/)
- `Task+Extensions.swift` - Task entity computed properties (isOverdue, isDueToday, etc.)
- `TaskCategory+Extensions.swift` - TaskCategory entity extensions

### Main Views (ModernToDoApp/Features/)
- `ContentView.swift` - Main tab view with TaskListView, CategoriesView, SettingsView, ProductivityChartView
- `TaskListView` - Main task list with sections (Overdue, Today, Tomorrow, Upcoming, etc.)
- `CategoriesView` - Category management interface
- `SettingsView` - App settings and preferences

### Detail Views (ModernToDoApp/Views/)
- `TaskDetailView.swift` - Task creation and editing form
- `CategoryDetailView.swift` - Category creation and editing

### Services (ModernToDoApp/Core/Services/)
- `NotificationManager.swift` - Local notification scheduling and management

### Enums (ModernToDoApp/Enums/)
- `TaskPriority.swift` - Task priority enum with colors and system images

### Extensions (ModernToDoApp/Extensions/)
- `Color+Extensions.swift` - Color hex string support

## Testing

The test suite includes comprehensive unit tests in `ModernToDoAppTests/`:
- Repository pattern tests (even though the main app doesn't use repositories)
- Core Data operations testing with in-memory stores
- Task entity relationship testing
- Performance tests for task creation
- Task priority and completion percentage testing

## Code Patterns

### SwiftUI Integration
- Views use `@FetchRequest` directly for Core Data queries
- `@AppStorage` for user preferences
- `@Environment(\.managedObjectContext)` for Core Data operations
- Sheet presentations for detail views
- Custom components like `AnimatedCheckbox`, `PriorityIndicatorView`, `FloatingActionButton`

### Core Data Patterns
- Entity extensions provide computed properties and business logic
- Automatic CloudKit sync with NSPersistentCloudKitContainer
- Relationships: Task â†” TaskCategory, Task â†” Task (parent/subtask)
- Proper deletion rules and cascade behavior

### Notification Integration
- NotificationManager singleton handles scheduling and cancellation
- Notifications tied to task due dates
- Automatic notification management on task completion/deletion
- User permission handling and settings integration

## Fixed Issues

### Category Button Issue
- Fixed color hex string generation in `Color+Extensions.swift`
- Corrected RGB format from ARGB to standard 6-digit hex
- Category creation and editing now works properly

### Date Picker Time Display
- Fixed time display in `CustomDatePickerField.swift`
- Changed from graphical to wheel date picker style for better time visibility
- Removed "Select Date" text and centered date picker vertically
- Added proper date formatting functions for consistent display
- Improved date parsing with multiple format support

## Recent Fixes (Latest Update)

### Category Add Button Issues Fixed
- **Root Cause**: FloatingActionButton category action was trying to access variables outside its scope
- **Solution**: Restructured component hierarchy to pass category creation callbacks properly
- **Changes Made**:
  - Updated `TaskListView` to accept both `showAddTask` and `showAddCategory` closure parameters
  - Modified `ContentView` to manage both task and category sheet states centrally
  - Fixed FloatingActionButton to call the correct closure for category creation
  - Ensured both "+ button in FloatingActionButton" and "+ button in Categories tab" work correctly

### Date Picker UI Improvements
- **Issue**: "Select Date" text was cluttering the interface and date picker wasn't centered
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed the date picker label by using empty string `""`
  - Added `.labelsHidden()` modifier for cleaner appearance
  - Used `Spacer()` elements to center the date picker vertically in the sheet
  - Maintained functionality while improving visual presentation

### Category Swipe Actions Added
- **New Feature**: Enhanced category management with swipe gestures
- **Implementation**: Added SwiftUI `swipeActions` modifiers to category list items
- **Functionality**:
  - **Swipe Right (Leading Edge)**: Shows "Delete" action with destructive styling
  - **Swipe Left (Trailing Edge)**: Shows "Edit" action with blue styling
  - **Tap Action**: Also opens edit dialog (existing functionality preserved)
- **User Experience**: Consistent with iOS standard swipe gesture patterns

### Postpone Date Picker Consistency
- **Issue**: Postpone task date picker had different UI style than due date picker
- **Solution**: Unified both date pickers to use the same consistent interface
- **Changes**:
  - Changed postpone date picker from `.graphical` to `.wheel` style
  - Removed date picker label (empty string) and added `.labelsHidden()`
  - Added `Spacer()` elements to center picker vertically
  - Moved "Save" button to navigation bar trailing position for consistency
- **Result**: Both due date setting and postpone operations now have identical, user-friendly interfaces

### Technical Details
- Category creation now works from both:
  1. FloatingActionButton â†’ "Add Category" sub-action
  2. Categories tab â†’ "+" toolbar button
- Category editing now works from:
  1. Tap gesture on category row
  2. Swipe left (trailing edge) â†’ "Edit" action
- Category deletion now works from:
  1. Swipe right (leading edge) â†’ "Delete" action
  2. Default iOS swipe-to-delete (.onDelete modifier)
- Date picker improvements provide better user experience for time selection
- All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
