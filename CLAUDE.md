```

## Current Architecture

The app uses a **simplified direct Core Data integration** pattern rather than full MVVM:

### Core Data Integration
- **Entities**: `Task` and `TaskCategory` with CloudKit synchronization enabled
- **Stack**: `PersistenceController` for CloudKit sync, `CoreDataStack` for basic operations
- **Extensions**: Entity extensions in `Core/Models/` provide computed properties and business logic

### SwiftUI Pattern
- **Views**: Direct `@FetchRequest` integration in SwiftUI views
- **State Management**: `@AppStorage` for user preferences, `@State` for local view state
- **Navigation**: Tab-based navigation with sheet presentations for details

### Services
- **NotificationManager**: Singleton for scheduling/canceling task notifications
- **No Repository Layer**: Views interact directly with Core Data through FetchRequest

## Core Features

### Task Management
- Create, edit, delete tasks with title, notes, and priority
- Priority levels (high, medium, low) with color-coded visual indicators
- Due dates with local notifications via UNUserNotificationCenter
- Subtasks and hierarchical task relationships (Core Data model supports this)
- Task completion with progress tracking for parent tasks
- Search functionality and category-based filtering
- Swipe actions and context menus for quick task operations
- Task postponing with date picker

### Categories & Organization
- Color-coded categories with custom icons
- Category-based task filtering via picker in main view
- Category management with creation, editing, and deletion
- Task count display for each category

### Advanced Features
- Offline-first with CloudKit synchronization (NSPersistentCloudKitContainer)
- Local notifications scheduled for task due dates
- Dark/light mode support with @AppStorage persistence
- Tab-based navigation (Tasks, Categories, Settings, Insights)
- Settings management for notifications and display preferences

## Recent Fixes (Latest Update)

### Long-Press Multi-Selection Removal (Latest)
- **User Request**: Remove long-press multi-selection behavior entirely from task list
- **Previous Behavior**: Long-press on task entered multi-selection mode with "Delete Selected" and "Cancel" toolbar buttons
- **Complete Removal**:
  - **Selection Mode Elimination**: Removed all multi-selection state variables (`isInSelectionMode`, `selectedTasks`)
  - **Long-Press Gesture Removal**: Completely removed `.onLongPressGesture()` from task cards
  - **Toolbar Simplification**: Removed conditional toolbar buttons and kept only the "+" add button
  - **Alert System Cleanup**: Removed multi-task deletion alerts and confirmation dialogs
- **Technical Changes**:
  - Removed `enterSelectionMode()`, `exitSelectionMode()`, `toggleTaskSelection()`, and `deleteSelectedTasks()` functions
  - Simplified `TaskCardView` by removing selection mode parameters (`isInSelectionMode`, `isSelected`, `onLongPress`)
  - Streamlined swipe actions to work without conditional selection mode logic
  - Updated `onDelete` handler to directly delete tasks without confirmation alerts
- **User Experience**:
  - Long-press on tasks now does nothing - no selection UI, no action, no visual feedback
  - Simplified toolbar with only essential "+" button for adding new tasks
  - All existing functionality preserved: tap to view details, swipe actions for edit/delete/complete
  - Cleaner, more focused user interface without unnecessary selection complexity

### Dark Mode Persistence Fix
- **Critical Issue**: Dark mode toggle and app theme were out of sync after app restart - toggle showed correct state but app reverted to wrong theme
- **Root Cause**: App was only applying dark mode preference on toggle changes, not on app startup, causing stored preference to be ignored on launch
- **Complete Solution**:
  - **App Startup Application**: Added `.onAppear` modifier to apply stored dark mode preference immediately when ContentView loads
  - **Scene Phase Handling**: Enhanced app lifecycle management to reapply preference when app becomes active from background
  - **Persistent Preference Storage**: Ensured `@AppStorage("isDarkMode")` value is consistently applied across all app states
  - **First Launch Detection**: Maintains system appearance detection on first launch while preserving manual user preferences thereafter
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - `applyStoredDarkModePreference()` method ensures UI matches stored toggle state on every app launch
  - Added preference application in both `.onAppear` and `.onChange(of: scenePhase)` for comprehensive coverage
  - Enhanced app lifecycle management with proper dark mode state synchronization
- **User Experience**:
  - Dark mode toggle and app theme now stay perfectly synchronized across app launches
  - User's manual dark/light mode preference persists reliably after app termination
  - First launch still automatically matches system appearance as intended
  - No more confusion between toggle state and actual app appearance

### Universal Keyboard Dismissal Implementation
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Implemented comprehensive keyboard dismissal functionality across all form screens
- **Smart Gesture Integration**: Added `.simultaneousGesture()` for keyboard dismissal that works alongside existing UI interactions
- **Universal Coverage**: Keyboard automatically dismisses when tapping outside text fields in:
  - Task creation and editing forms (TaskDetailView)
  - Category creation and editing forms (CategoryDetailView)  
  - Search bars in main lists (TaskListView, CategoriesView)
  - Settings screen forms
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - UIApplication extension with `dismissKeyboard()` method
  - SwiftUI View extensions for different dismissal patterns
  - Non-intrusive gesture handling that preserves existing UI functionality
- **User Experience**:
  - Natural iOS behavior - tap outside text field to dismiss keyboard
  - Works on all screens with text input without breaking other interactions
  - Improves form usability and prevents keyboard from staying open unnecessarily

### Task Detail Sheet Opening Fix (Latest)
- **Critical Issue**: Task row taps were inconsistent - sometimes opening detail view, sometimes not working
- **Root Cause**: Multiple sheet modifiers on the same view causing SwiftUI gesture conflicts and sheet precedence issues  
- **Complete Solution**:
  - **Unified Sheet Management**: Implemented `TaskSheetType` enum to consolidate all sheet states
  - **Single Sheet Modifier**: Replaced 3 separate `.sheet()` modifiers with one unified sheet using switch statement
  - **Dedicated PostponeTaskView**: Created separate component for postpone date picker to avoid sheet conflicts
  - **Gesture Simplification**: Ensured TaskRowView uses same simple Button pattern as CategoryRowView
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - `TaskSheetType` enum with cases: `.detail(Task)`, `.edit(Task)`, `.postpone(Task, Date)`
  - Single `@State private var activeSheet: TaskSheetType?` replaces multiple state variables
  - TaskRowView onTap sets `activeSheet = .detail(task)` for consistent behavior
  - PostponeTaskView handles date selection with proper dismissal callbacks
- **User Experience**: 
  - Task detail opening now works consistently with single taps like categories
  - All swipe actions (postpone, edit, delete, complete) preserved and functional
  - Postpone date picker shows wheel-style date/time selection instead of auto +1 day

### Notification Badge System Overhaul
- **Critical Issue**: Notification badges showing incorrect counts when multiple notifications delivered simultaneously
- **Root Cause**: Previous badge logic was setting each notification badge to 1, causing overwrite instead of increment
- **Complete Solution**:
  - **Smart Badge Counting**: Implemented `getTotalNotificationCount()` that combines delivered + pending notifications
  - **Proper Badge Increment**: Each new notification gets badge value of (total_existing_notifications + 1)
  - **Automatic Badge Clearing**: `clearAppBadge()` resets icon badge when app enters foreground
  - **UIKit Integration**: Added `import UIKit` for proper badge number management
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - `scheduleNotification()` now uses asynchronous counting with DispatchGroup
  - Badge calculation: `content.badge = NSNumber(value: totalCount + 1)`
  - App lifecycle integration via `willEnterForegroundNotification`
- **User Experience**: 
  - Multiple simultaneous notifications show correct cumulative count (2, 3, 4...)
  - App badge clears immediately when opening app
  - Notification count accurately reflects all unread notifications

### Swipe-to-Complete Implementation (Latest Update)
- **Checkbox System Removal**: Completely removed problematic AnimatedCheckbox component that caused inconsistent toggle behavior
- **Swipe-to-Complete**: Implemented leading edge swipe gesture for task completion with green/orange color coding
- **Visual Indicators**: Added green completion bar and checkmark icon for completed tasks
- **Real-time UI Updates**: Fixed UI reactivity by removing manual caching system that blocked SwiftUI's automatic updates
- **Dynamic Task Movement**: Tasks now move between categories (Overdue, Today, Completed, etc.) instantly without app restart
- **Performance Optimized**: Added haptic feedback and smooth animations with error recovery
- **SwiftUI Reactivity**: Replaced cached arrays with computed properties to enable @FetchRequest automatic updates

### Performance Optimization & Bug Fixes

- **Root Cause**: Gesture conflicts between keyboard dismissal gesture in TaskDetailView and calendar button action
- **Complete Solution**:
  - **Enhanced Button Styling**: Added proper visual styling with blue color and 44x44pt tap target
  - **High Priority Gesture**: Used `.highPriorityGesture()` to ensure calendar button receives tap events before keyboard dismissal
  - **Content Shape Definition**: Added `.contentShape(Rectangle())` for consistent tap area

- **User Experience**: 
  - Calendar icon now consistently opens date and time picker
  - Matches behavior of working postpone date picker functionality
  - No interference with keyboard dismissal or other UI interactions

### Real-time Overdue Task Movement Fix
- **Critical Issue**: Tasks weren't automatically moving to "Overdue" section when due dates passed while app was running
- **Root Cause**: Task categorization used static `Date()` evaluations; SwiftUI only re-evaluates when Core Data changes, not when time passes
- **Complete Solution**:
  - **Refresh Trigger**: Added `@State private var refreshTrigger = Date()` to force view re-evaluation
  - **Dynamic Date Evaluation**: Modified `groupedTasks` computed property to use current date instead of static computed properties
  - **30-Second Timer**: Implemented periodic refresh every 30 seconds to check for overdue tasks
  - **App Lifecycle Integration**: Immediate refresh when app returns to foreground via `UIApplication.willEnterForegroundNotification`
  - **Proper Timer Management**: Timer automatically starts/stops with view appearance/disappearance
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Modified `TaskListView` in `ContentView.swift` with timer-based refresh mechanism
  - Added `startOverdueTimer()` and `stopOverdueTimer()` functions for lifecycle management
  - Updated task filtering logic to use real-time date evaluation instead of cached computed properties
  - Maintained thread safety with `DispatchQueue.main.async` for UI updates
- **User Experience**: 
  - Tasks automatically move between sections (Today ‚Üí Overdue, etc.) in real-time
  - No need to restart app or manually refresh to see overdue tasks
  - Battery efficient - timer only runs when TaskListView is active
  - Smooth transitions without disrupting existing functionality

### Immediate Notification Badge Update Fix
- **Critical Issue**: App icon badge numbers weren't updating immediately when notifications were delivered in background
- **Root Cause**: Notification badge setting was commented out; counting logic included all notifications instead of filtering task-specific ones
- **Complete Solution**:
  - **Enabled Badge Setting**: Uncommented `content.badge = NSNumber(value: totalCount + 1)` in notification content
  - **Smart Badge Counting**: Created `getTaskNotificationCount()` to filter and count only task-related notifications
  - **Task-Specific Filtering**: Filter notifications by "Task Due:" title prefix to avoid counting non-task notifications
  - **Accurate Incrementation**: Combine delivered + pending task notifications for proper badge calculation
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Modified `NotificationManager.swift` with improved badge counting logic
  - Replaced `getTotalNotificationCount` with `getTaskNotificationCount` for precise filtering
  - Added notification filtering by title prefix to distinguish task notifications
  - Maintained all existing notification scheduling and cancellation logic
- **User Experience**: 
  - App icon badge updates instantly when task due notifications are delivered
  - No need to open app or bring to foreground for badge updates
  - Accurate badge count reflects only unread task notifications
